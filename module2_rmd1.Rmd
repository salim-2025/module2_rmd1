Here is a word in **bold** and another word in __bold__.

Here is word in *italic* and another word in _italic_.

Here is a word in ***bold*** and another word in ___bold___.

When we compile our document, we are using the `rmarkdown` package.



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
